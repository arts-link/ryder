It is a truly peaceful moment. This is it, just place an image in your sites `static/images` directory called `hidden-home-cover.webp` and it will be used for this background image. This page is good to hide your hugo site behind while you are working on things.  

Another version of this page is [randomly peaceful](../randomly-peaceful) and it will load a bg-image from an array you are passing

Since there are no links on this page, just click back to [exampleSite](../).  

To create a page like this, just set your front matter to contain `layout='hidden-home'`.
