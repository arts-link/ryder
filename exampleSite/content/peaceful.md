It is a truly peaceful moment. This is it, just place an image in your sites `static/images` directory called `hidden-home-cover.webp` and it will be used for this background image. This page is good to hide your hugo site behind while you are working on things.  

Since there are no links on this page, just click back to get back to the exampleSite.  

To create a page like this, just set your front matter to contain `layout='hidden-home'`.
