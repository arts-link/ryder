By adding these params to your front matter you can have the post show up in a special box on the home page of the website.

## Front Matter

```
+++
homeFeature = true
homeFeatureTitle = "Debug Panel"
homeFeatureIcon = "fa-solid fa-binoculars"
+++
```

If you don't have this front matter there, the boxes will not show up at all.  This can be used for both regular pages, `index.md` template, and list page `_index.md` template.
