# the ryder theme  

v0.1 - This theme is pretty barebones, with a few additions to get things setup quickly.

The reason it is called the ryder theme is because I was having a hard time thinking of a name to use that wasn't totally lame, but described the function of the theme. Since I had failed to do this in a short period of time, I decided to name it after my late friend and companion, the rhodesian ridgeback / mastiff dog named Ryder.
